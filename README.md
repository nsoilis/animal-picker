An interactive questionnaire to help identify mammals in Pennsylvania. 

Hello!
Thank you for using my mammal identifier, here are some answers for some questions you might have?

Q) Can this help me identify birds?
A) No, I don't know birds very well

Q) Can this help me identify reptiles?
A) No, but if its long and has a rattle you should run

Q) This program tells me I found a coyote, but i'm sure I found a dog.
A) You found a coyote.

This program was made by watching/reading bits and pieces of various youtube videos and java support question forums. It is most likely not optimal, but it does 
work to the degree I was hoping for, and as a first solo project goes, I am fairly happy with the results.

I welcome any and all feedback, comments, concerns, and ideas for improvement. 
Thanks again for using my Mammal Identifier
